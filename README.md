Seminary in Israel Guide

I built this web app to make day-to-day seminary life in Israel less stressful. It pulls together all the things I kept needing—budgeting, tracking expenses, bus info, currency conversions—so everything is in one spot and easy to use.

Features

Expense Tracker: Add and delete expenses quickly.

Saved Data: Everything is stored with Local Storage, so your info stays even after closing the browser.

Instant Updates: The table and totals update right away without refreshing.

Currency Converter: Simple USD  ILS conversions so you can estimate costs fast.

Transportation Guide: Clear charts with common bus routes and fares.

Info & Tips: Useful things for students spending the year abroad.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure and multi-page setup.

CSS3 & Bootstrap: Clean, responsive layout for both mobile and desktop.

JavaScript (ES6):

DOM manipulation for building and updating the expense table.

Local Storage for saving, reading, and deleting data.

Event handling for forms and buttons.

Defensive checks so the script doesn’t break on pages missing certain elements.
